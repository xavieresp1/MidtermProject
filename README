Game Idea:
3D Snake:
The player controls and sees through a green sphere (the head of the snake). 
The head will move through a fixed-size room and will make contact with yellow spheres. 
The head is able to turn left and right(with the A and D keys); and is able to only move
forwards(W key). The mechanic that we will be adding is allowing the snake to jump over 
its tail, using the spacebar. The yellow spheres will disappear after they have had 
contact with the green sphere. After each yellow sphere disappears, another will spawn
in a different location of the map. When the first yellow sphere disappears, the head 
will spawn a green cube(tail) that is attached to the head. Each yellow sphere that 
disappears afterwards will cause a green cube to be attached to the previous last 
cube of the tail. The tail will follow the path of the head. If the head touches 
any part of the tail, the game will end. The player wins if the tail of the snake
takes up the entire play area.
